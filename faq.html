		<h2>Why don't you have <span class="amazing">$INSERT_AMAZING_SITE_HERE</span> on the searcher?</h2>
		<h3>If it's related to Agile, I probably didn't know about it or forgot to add. Send me the site url (or <a href="http://www.google.com/support/customsearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=71826" target="_blank">url pattern</a>) at agilesearcher@vidageek.net</h3>

		<h2>There is too much noise. Can't you do anything about it?</h2>
		<h3>Well, there is much less noise than a simple Google Search. But even so there is much more noise than I'd like it to have. Want to help me cleaning up? Send me an email at agilesearcher@vidageek.net</h3>

		<h2>Hey, this is amazing! How can I contribute?</h2>

		<a href="#" name="ugly"></a>
		<h2>Hey, this site is really ugly. Can't you improve how it looks?</h2>

		<a href="#" name="why"></a>
		<h2>Why did you spend time on this?</h2>
		<h3>I was creating a new course for <a href="http://www.adaptworks.com.br">AdaptWorks</a> and got really bored from looking for references on Google. I created a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse"> Google Custom Search Engine</a> with a bunch of sites to make my life easier. Since it really worked for me, i bet it can work for some other people too, so why not open it for anyone who wants?</h3>
